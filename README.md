# Houston pollen data

This repository uses GitHub actions to scrape pollen data collected by [Houston health](https://www.houstonhealth.org/services/pollen-mold/). It records each day's data in a parquet file in [`data/`](data/) and also creates an collapsed parquet file for each year in [`collapsed/`](collapsed/).
